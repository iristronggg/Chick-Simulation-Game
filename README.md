# Chick-Simulation-Game
An animal simulation game.
- Users raise virtual animals through the web interface, and interact wit animals to transform them into different stages.
- We build a distributed web microservice utilizing BigTable to manage the various stages of virtual animals.
- The system is deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine with autoscaling capabilities, and it has also undergone load testing and spike testing.
